## Estimating a population parameter
- If we take a large sample will the sample mean be exactly equal to the population mean?  
- If we take two large samples of equal size will the two sample means be exactly the same?  
- If we calculate the mean value by measuring everyone in the population and repeat the process will we get the same value?

## Properties of samples
```{r}
hist(a, 10,
     col = "lightgray",
     main = "Distribution of Marks (N = 10, 000)",
     sub = paste("Mean = ", round(mean(a),1),
                 "SD = ", round(sd(a),1)),
     xlab = "Marks")
```

## Samples of size 64
### Number of repetitions 100
```{r}
hist(r64100, 11,
     col = "lightgray",
     main = "Distribution of Sample Means (N = 100)",
     sub = paste0("Mean of sample means = ", round(mean(r64100),1),
                  ";  ",
                 "SD of sample means = ", round(sd(r64100),2),
                 ";  ",
                 "Size of samples = 64"),
     xlab = "")

What will be the minimum value of the sample means if we repeat this process **1000** times?  
It will be    
1. Lower than 45.0  
2. Higher than 45.0  
3. Cannot be predicted

## Estimation and Inference

- We are not interested in the sample statistics for their own sake.  
- We are interested in the population parameter
  + Confidence interval or
  + P value  

## 95% Confidence Interval  

- We know that the mean calculated from repeat samples of the same size form a Normal distribution.  
- The mean of these means will be equal to the population mean and the standard deviation of these sample means is called the standard error. 
- Therefore, 95% of sample means will be within 1.96 standard errors of the population mean.  
- The probability of any particular sample mean being within 1.96 standard errors of the population mean is 95%.  
  
## Type I Error and the Level of Significance 
- The probability of of rejecting a true null hypothesis.  
- This is equal to the P value.   
- We can reduce the probability of making a type I error by making P < 0.01 the level of significance.  

## Type II Error and Power
- Even when there is a difference between the means of two groups we may fail to detect this difference (fail to reject the null hypothesis) in a particular study.  
- The probability of not being able to detect a true difference is called the Type II error.   
- We fail to reject the null hypothesis due to not having enough evidence against the null hypothesis.   
- A common reason for this is inadequate sample size.  

## Impotance of calculating sample size  
- Inadequate sample size leads to inconclusive results.  
- Unnecessarily large sample size leads to waste of resources.  
- When should we calculate the sample size?  
  + At the time of protocol development  
  + Consider it along with the objectives  
  
## How to calculate?
- Use formulae and calculate  
  + Using a calculator or MS Excel - Risky and not reproducible
- Use appropriate software  
  + Winpepi
  + OpenEpi
  + Many others ....  
- Use published tables
  + Lwanga & Lemeshow

## Sample Size Calculation for a Descriptive Study

- To determine a mean or percentage along with the 95% confidence interval.  

- Is the 95% confidence interval acceptable?  

## Sample Size Calculation for a Descriptive Study

- To determine a percentage along with the 95% confidence interval.
- Expected percentage 50%
- Desired 95% CI 45% to 55%



Is the 95% confidence interval acceptable?


What if you can afford only a particular sample size?   

Can we go ahead and do a prevalence study if the maximum possible sample size is 200?

## What if you can afford only 200 participants? {.smaller}
```{r}
a <- binom.test(10, 200)
print(paste0("If the prevalence is ", round(a$estimate*100,1), "%", ", the 95% CI will be from ", round(a$conf.int[1]*100, 1), " to ", round(a$conf.int[2]*100, 1)))  
a <- binom.test(20, 200)
print(paste0("If the prevalence is ", round(a$estimate*100,1), "%", ", the 95% CI will be from ", round(a$conf.int[1]*100, 1), " to ", round(a$conf.int[2]*100, 1)))  
a <- binom.test(50, 200)
print(paste0("If the prevalence is ", round(a$estimate*100,1), "%", ", the 95% CI will be from ", round(a$conf.int[1]*100, 1), " to ", round(a$conf.int[2]*100, 1)))  
a <- binom.test(100, 200)
print(paste0("If the prevalence is ", round(a$estimate*100,1), "%", ", the 95% CI will be from ", round(a$conf.int[1]*100, 1), " to ", round(a$conf.int[2]*100, 1)))

```
## Sample Size Calculation for Analytical Studies
- Cross sectional  
- Cohort  
- Case control  
- Clinical trial
- All these can be expressed as difference between two proportions
- Cross sectional study & Clinical trial can be difference between means.  

---
![](Designs2019.png)

## Analytical study
- Level of significance (usually 0.05)
- Power (either 80% or 90%)
- Expected difference  
- Difference between two means
  + Estimates of the two standard deviations
- Difference between two proportion
  + Estimates of the two proportions

## Increasing power without increasing sample size

1. How to do do it?  
2. What are the consequences?  

## Sample size Calculation for a Case Control Study  
"We wanted to identify factors that doubled the risk of home deliveries and had 50% prevalence in the community. Sample size was determined using Epi Info version 6. With 95% confidence and power of 80%, the calculated minimum sample size was 111 cases and 222 controls."  
					(Lukumar 2006)  
					
## Sample size Calculation for a Clinical Trial
- Treatment of metastatic prostate cancer  
- Orchidectomy vs Orchidectomy + Drug A  
- Outcome - Time to recurrence (Increase in PSA)
- Follow up - 18 months
- Information needed?  


## Sample size Calculation for a Clinical Trial
- Treatment of metastatic prostate cancer  
- Orchidectomy vs Orchidectomy + Drug A  
- Outcome - Time to recurrence (Increase in PSA)
- Follow up - 18 months
- Information needed?  

Information needed - % with recurrence  following Orchidectomy in 18 months & improvement expected by adding Drug A  

## Other issues
- Design effect  
- Unequal size groups
- More than two groups  

## Writing it up 
- From -Statistics Guide for Research Grant Applicants
- A sample of 324 patients with asthma will be required to obtain a 95% confidence interval of +/- 5% around a prevalence estimate of 30%. To allow for an expected 70% response rate to the questionnaire, a total of 480 questionnaires will be delivered.

## Another example
- A sample size of 292 babies (146 in each of the treatment and placebo groups) will be sufficient to detect a difference of 16% between groups in the sepsis rate at 14 days, with 80% power and a 5% significance level. This 16% difference represents the difference between a 50% sepsis rate in the placebo group and a 34% rate in the treatment group.

## Presenting/ Reviewing sample size calculation

- Enough information to independently verify the calculation?
- Background values justified/ referenced?
- Effect size 'clinically' relevant?
- Effect size realistic?
