Probability and features:   
a. Joint probability  
b. Conditional Probability  
c. Binomial distribution  
d. Poisson distribution  

## Probability

Probability simply means the likelihood of an event occurring.  

This is measured as the ratio of the number of occurrences of the particular event to the total number of events.

## Coin Toss {.scrollable}

* When you toss a coin, how likely is getting a Head?  

* When you toss a coin twice, how likely is
    + getting two Heads?
    + getting two Tails?
    + getting a Head and a Tail?  
    
* When you toss a coin thrice, how likely is
    + getting three Heads?
    + getting two Heads and a Tail?
    + getting a Head and two Tails?
    + getting three tails?

## Proability of independent events

* Single toss - two outcomes - probability of a head = 
    + $\frac{1}{2}$ or $\frac{1}{2^1}$
* Two tosses - four possible outcomes - prob of two heads = 
    + $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2}$ or $\frac{1}{2^2}$
* Three tosses - eight possible outcomes - prob of three heads = 
    + $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2}$ or $\frac{1}{2^3}$

## Basic Rules of Probability

* Range 0.0 to 1.0
    + 0.0 = Never
    + 1.0 = Definite/Always
* Addition Rule
    + for mutually exclusive events
* Multiplication Rule
    + for independent events
    
## Probability exercises  

1. Calculate the probability of getting a one or a six on rolling a die.
2. Calculate the probability of getting an even number on rolling a die.
3. Calculate the probability of getting two sixes on rolling two dice together.
4. Calculate the probability of getting a number less than 5 or a head on rolling a die and tossing a coin together.
5. A woman has exactly two children.  At least one of them is a boy. What is the probability that the other is a girl?  

## Probability exercises {.scrollable}  

1. Calculate the probability of getting a one or a six on rolling a die. $\frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$
2. Calculate the probability of getting an even number on rolling a die. $\frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$
3. Calculate the probability of getting two sixes on rolling two dice together. $\frac{1}{6} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36}$
4. Calculate the probability of getting a number less than 5 or a head on rolling a die and tossing a coin together. $\frac{4}{6} + \frac{1}{2} - \frac{4}{6} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{7}{6} - \frac{2}{6}  = \frac{5}{6}$
5. A woman has exactly two children.  At least one of them is a boy. What is the probability that the other is a girl?  $\frac{2}{3}$

  "Pos", 90, 90, 180,

**What is the probability of a person selected at random from these 1000 people being diseased?**

\  

**What is the probability of a person with a positive test being diseased?**

## Joint probability

The probability of a particular combination of events out of two separate random events i.e. getting a head on a coin toss and getting a six on rolling a die at the same time.  Given by the formula -   
$$P(H \, and \, 6) = P(H) \times P(6\,|\,H)$$
Is the probability of getting a 6 influenced by the toss?

$$P(6\,|\,H) = P(6)$$

$$P(H \, and \, 6) = P(H) \times P(6)$$


## Normal Distribution| Gausian Distribution

* The distribution of many biological variables in the population follow a pattern  
* Data concentrated around the mean  
* Values on either side of the mean occur in equal frequency  
* Frequency of values fall as they get away from the mean
* Most values (68.3%) are within one standard deviation on either side of the mean  
* Large majority (95.0%) are within two standard deviations on either side of the mean  
* Almost all values (99.7%) are within three standard deviations on either side of the mean  

## Normal Distribution
```{r normal_d1.1}
cp <- c(mean=50, s.d.=10, gamma1= 0)
dp <- cp2dp(cp, family="SN")
set.seed = 1802
y <- as.data.frame(round(rsn(20000, dp=dp)))
colnames(y)[1] <- "Marks"
ggplot(data = y, aes(Marks)) +
geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color = "black", , fill = "white")

```


\   

* Examples of negative skew distribution
    + Period of gestation
    + Lifespan
    + Marks in an easy test
    
## Detecting skew distribution
* Visualize the data - Histogram
* Check the mean and the median
* Check the values mean - 2sd and mean + 2sd
    + are these values possible
    + are these values believable
    
##  Dealing with skew distribution
* Use appropriate transformation if possible
* Use the median and quantiles as descriptive statistics

## Difficult situations
* zeros
* Negative numbers  

\  

* Use other distributions such as
    + Negative binomial
    + Poisson
